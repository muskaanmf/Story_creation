List of characters and give an intro 

Ross Geller
Friends is very much an ensemble show, without one singular protagonist. That said, if there is one protagonist (at least at the beginning of the series), it's definitely Ross Geller (David Schwimmer).

Monica Geller
Monica Geller is two years younger than her brother Ross, and grew up with him on Long Island, where they were raised Jewish. 

Rachel Green
Rachel Green also grew up on Long Island, with her parents, Leonard (Ron Leibman) and Sandra (Marlo Thomas), and sisters Amy (Christina Applegate) and Jill (Reese Witherspoon).

Chandler Bing
Chandler Bing was the only son of Nora (Morgan Fairchild) and Charles Bing (Kathleen Turner), who split up when Chandler was nine because Charles was sleeping with the pool boy and had decided to come out and live openly as gay. 

Phoebe Buffay
Phoebe Buffay had a much rougher childhood than any of her friends. She and her twin sister Ursula (also Lisa Kudrow) were conceived in a threesome between Phoebe Abbott (Teri Garr), Frank Buffay (Bob Balaban), and Lily Buffay. 

Joey Tribbiani
Joey Tribbiani Jr. grew up as the only boy out of eight children in an Italian family in Queens.
